Overview
--------

Babyphone is a baby monitoring application that measures the audio
noise level. If a configurable threshold is exceeded it calls a
predefined phone number (the parents).

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the license, or
(at your option) any later version.


Features
--------

- measures audio level using the built in microphone
- allows setting of threshold for audio volume and duration for triggering
- establishes a voice call to the predefined number on such event
- incoming calls are rejected during monitoring (to not wake up the baby)
- automatically answer incoming call from parents
- inform about missed calls (per SMS) or forward them to parents phone
- use address book for phone number lookup

Planned upcoming features, not implemented yet:
- adaptive self-configuration of audio thresholds
- ...


Supported Systems
-----------------

The application runs on Maemo 5 PR 1.2 or later and MeeGo Harmattan (Maemo 6).
Therefore it supports the Nokia N900, Nokia N950 and Nokia N9 devices.

Since the development is done using Qt porting the application to other Qt
platforms like Symbian should be possible.


Installation
------------

The installation follows the usual sequence of Maemo devices. It will be part
of the community repository.


Usage
-----

After you start the application you must configure the parents phone number.
This phone number will be called in case of loud environment.

You may want to adjust the other parameters. Most important is:
- Audio Amplification: If you increase this value the babyphone will be more
  sensitive to the audio level, which means it will call earlier.
- Time Influence: If you increase this value the loud audio noise needs to be
  present for a longer time. Therefore a higher value makes the babyphone less
  sensitive.

The two graphs on the main screen help you to adjust these audio settings.
The upper graph displays the audio level. Everytime you see a red line the
threshold is exceeded.
However, the phone does not call the parents already at the first loud audio
sample. The noise need to be present for some time. This is reflected by the
bottom graph. The counter value is increased on loud noise and decreased if it
is silent. As the gray threshold line gets exceeded the parents will be called.

After setting all values you need to go back to the first tab and click the
button at the bottom. The text will change and indicate the active status.

As the babyphone established a phone call at high audio volume, you can take
the call to hear your baby. As you finish the call the babyphone application
gets active again after the timeout specified in the "Phone Recall Timer"
settings. The phone will call you then again as the noise level gets above the
threshold.
